# This is my Tamagotchi-like game!

**Hi. This is game which I did for my javascript practice - I know I could make my this code cleaner, but in this very moment when I did this, I gave it 100%. Updates, upgrades and any new ideas which I can implemented to this game to improve this project, will show up with the ver. 3.0 which will show up in the next few months**

## Short guide

**The goal in this game is to collect as much points as it possible. You can do this buy clicking on the buttons with `FEED`, `CLEAN`, `PLAY` when the animation will show up next to button, and under commands below it. 

`The current animation of the bunny will change depending on the number of points earned.`**
