# This is my Tamagotchi-like game!

**Hi. This is game which I did for my javascript practice - I know I could make this code cleaner, reduce duplication and correct some mistakes and omissions, but in this very moment when I did this, I gave it 100% from myself. I don't really plan to improve this project. I will probably write a new version from scratch, taking into account everything I have learned up to this point.

## Short guide

The goal in this game is to collect as much points as it possible. You can do this buy clicking on the buttons with `FEED`, `CLEAN`, `PLAY` when the animation will show up next to button, and under commands below it. 

`The current animation of the bunny will change depending on the number of points earned.`
